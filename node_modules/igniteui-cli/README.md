## Installation

Install the npm package as a global module:

```bash
npm install -g igniteui-cli
```

## Usage
The main entry point is `igniteui` and is also aliased as `ig`. Both can be used interchangeably to call available commands. Check out our [Wiki documentation](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/wiki) for more details.

### Step by step
To get a guided experience through the available options, simply run:

```bash
ig
```

Upon creation, project will be automatically loaded in the default browser.
**NOTE**: If that doesn't happen the port may be already in use. Ports vary for different project types, see the description for the [`ig start`](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/wiki/Start) command for details on default ports.

### List the available commands.

```bash
ig help
```
### Generate and serve quickstart projects
For a jump start and a sample overview of the Ignite UI controls, you can choose a "quickstart" to generate a project with predefined Ignite UI controls for each of the supported frameworks.

```bash
ig quickstart --framework=<framework>
```
### Generating projects and adding components

Create a new project passing name, framework and style theme.
```bash
ig new <project name> --framework=<framework> --type=<proj-type> --theme=<theme>
```
Parameters besides name are optional. Framework default to "jquery", project type defaults to the first available in the framework and theme to the first available for the project.

Add a new component or template to the project passing component ID and choosing a name.

```bash
ig add <component/template> <component_name>
```

The ID matches either a component ("grid", "combo", "text-editor", etc) or a predefined template. Predefined templates are framework/project specific and can provide predefined views with either multiple components or fulfilling a specific use case like "form-validation", "master-detail" and so on.

### Build and run
```bash
ig build
ig start
```
## Contribution

See the [Contribution guide](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

### Run locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Open in Visual Studio Code
    
    There is a predefined launch.config file for VS Code in the root folder, so you can use VS Code View/Debug window and choose one of the predefined actions. These include launching the step by step guide, quickstart project, create new project for a particular framework or add components.

4. Hit Start Debugging/F5

## Data Collection

The Ignite UI CLI tool uses Google Analytics to anonymously report feature usage statistics and basic crash reports. This data is used to help improve the Ignite UI CLI tools over time. You can opt out of analytics before any data is sent by using

```bach
ig config set disableAnalytics true -g
```

when using the CLI. You can read Infragistics privacy policy at https://www.infragistics.com/legal/privacy.
